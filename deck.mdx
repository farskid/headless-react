# Headless React

---

![Headless](https://github.com/farskid/headless-react/raw/master/assets/headless.jpg)

---

## It's all about render

```js

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    // Render here
  }
}

```

`render`: the only required method

---

## It's all about rendering

- Delrataive renderings
- Not a framework but a rendering library

---

## It's all about rendering

![thinking-react.png](https://github.com/farskid/headless-react/raw/master/assets/thinking-react.png)
- Thinking in React === Thinking about different rendering sections

---

## It's all about rendering

- Render based on props vs Render based on props and state
- Statefull vs Stateless, Container vs Component, Dumb vs Smart

What if I told you, React is
>NOT ONLY FOR RENDERING

?

---

# What the heck does HEADLESS mean?

Headless ~ Renderless

No Rendering === No GUI

---

# Headless in React

- Render nothing! `return null`
- Delegate rendering (Render Props) `this.props.children(...args)`
- Decorating (HOC) `withRouter` `connect`

## Basic CoinFlip

# Re-use in Blog

Bring back Tails and Heads text for SEO

- Support 2 usecases with different implementations

---

---

## Add reflip button ONLY in the app

- Add a button to flip again on click

###  The co-worker disaster Happens!

Your coworker comes by and wants to re-use your CoinFlip component for new usecase `<DiceRoll />`

- Totally different interface
- Also be used in both app and blog
- Totally different odd! (diceroll in 1/6 but coinflip is 1/2)

---

# Now What?

- Sorry, go dice yourself.
- Add DiceRoll to CoinFlip too!

(üîâ Crushing barebones sound in the background)

# Headless Component enters

Let's decouple the logic from rendering.

## Sum up the Story

- Probability, 1st abstraction, Headless (different odds)
- CoinFlip and DiceRolle, 2nd abstraction, Still Headless (different implementations)
- BlogCoinFlip, AppCoinFlip, BlogDiceRoll, AppDiceRoll

---

# Advantages

- Separation of concerns
- Easier to reason about
- Easier to test
- Decoupling === (maintainable, small learning curve)
- Reusable, Composable
- Scalable for change of requirements

---

# Disadvantages

- Same as other abstractions
- Implementation cost (time, code size)
- Cost of indirection
- Codebase learning curve

---

# When to use?

Like any other abstractions, when the benefits weigh more than the costs.

---

# What to cover with this pattern?

- Declarative Side effects (fetch, logging, timers, Web Speech, Geolocation, WebRTC handlers, ...)
- Separating Logics (Abstract logics, State moderation)
- Declatarive data structures (Map, set, WeakMap, List)

---

# What to cover with this pattern?

- Declarative feedbacks (Hover, Focus, Active)
- Declarative Form Data (!!)
- Declarative State reducers, state selectors (Redux in React üò±)

# Realworld examples

- [DownShift, accessible react component](https://github.com/paypal/downshift)

- [React PowerPlug, renderless containers](https://github.com/renatorib/react-powerplug)
